# Experimental quantum adversarial learning with superconducting qubits

In our recent work [Experimental quantum adversarial learning with programmable superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01738), we have experimentally implemented the quantum adversarial learning with high-dimensional real-life images and quantum data.
Here, we provide the codes for numerical simulations, processings of the experimental data, and the codes for plotting the figures in our paper.
